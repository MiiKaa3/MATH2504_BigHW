    "1. The code would still work because typing is not mandatory, however, my linter and IDE analysis tools might be a little messed up now, because the function can recieve any data as arguments instead of the numbers it expects. This could lead to unexpected or strange behaviours (like, if a, b, and c were string how would the delta varaible be caluclated? how would the roots be calculated?)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 4ac doesn't work! Variable names can't start with a 4, so Julia is smart enough to know that 4a means 4 times some variable called a. However, 4ac is arbitrary: do i want 4 times some varaible called a times some variable called c, or do i want one multiplication of 4 and some variable called \"ac.\" When it runs, we get \"ac is not defined\" (ACTUALLY, 2 letter names are allowed, i tested this by starting the function with ac=1, and it ran just fine! The problem is it knows i want 4 times some varaible, and if ac is defined, then itll use ac. howver, we run into problems when \"a\" \"c\" and \"ac\" are all defined, however this issue is not brought up by the complier or the linter, so its up to the programmer to be smart about their naming conventions!)\n",

    "\n",
    "6. `real_roots_of_quadratic(0,5,-6)` returns `2-element Vector{Float64}: NaN -Inf`. This is because b^2 - 4ac = b^2 > 0 ensures we divide by 0 when we calculate the roots (.../2a=.../2(0)=.../0).\n",

    "7. Yes, this seems to work, in the sense that my code doesn't crash out anymore\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Yes this works. When Julia assess/executes the Boolean statement `a == 0 && return \"Error - ...\"` it intially assess `a == 0`. If this is false, the `&&` resolves to false regardless of what the right-hand operand is. Hence the right hand doesn't get executed. If `a== 0` is true, then Julia executes the right hand operand and `return \"Error - ...\"` is run, breaking us away from the function, and returning control to the parent function/Julia/OS/etc.\n",

    "9. Instead of returning control to the parent function/Julia/OS/etc., it crashes the program and spits out the DomainError and explanation, so that the user can debug and fix their code.

Finally, `.- 1000.` performs an element-wise subtraction of 1000.0 (a float) on the vector, giving us the desired range [-1000, 1000]. Finally, to achieve the range [-5, 5] I would rewrite the expression as `a, b, c = 10rand(3) .- 5.`. \n",

For `root_count` i tried to find an equivilent to Python's `random.randint()` but couldn't find anything like that in the Julia docs, so i had to generate the numbers in the range i wanted manually. my code randomly picks a root count, we skipp 0 because if the root count is 0, there are no real roots to check we're calculating correctly. Next we generate a vector with root_count number of roots in some range (the default is [-1000,1000]). Next, we calculate the coefficents. This is just classic year 8 level algebra. The calculation is dependent on root count though. Finally, we ship those calculated coefficents to the `real_roots_of_quadratic` function, and then I sort the output (that way I can be sure that the correct roots are being compared). Finally, i iterate over the roots, zipped with the calculated roots, and I check that the difference between each pair is approximately equal to 0, down to some error term. If they are, test_passed remains true, else, it is set to false. After 10,000 itterations (by default), we return `test_passed`."
