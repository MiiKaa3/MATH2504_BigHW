Now let’s tackle your calculus question: To find the integral of \\\\(x^2\\\\) from 0 to 1, we first need to determine its indefinite integral and then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by evaluating it at the upper limit (which is x=1) and subtracting its value at the lower limit (which is x=0).\\n\\nFirstly, let’s find the antiderivative or indefinite integral of \\\\(x^2\\\\), which can be done using a power rule. The general form for this would be \\\\(\\\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\\\), where n = 2 (since our function is x squared). So, we have:\\n\\n∫x² dx = \\\\frac{x³}{3} + C\\n\\nwhere 'C' represents the constant of integration. However, since you’re interested in a definite integral from 0 to 1, this ‘+C‘ will not be needed later on as it cancels out when subtracting these two bounds. Now we need to evaluate \\\\(\\\\frac{x³}{3}\\\\) at x=1 and x=0:\\n\\nAt x = 1, the value of our function is \\\\(\\\\frac{1^3}{3} = \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\). At x = 0, this equals zero (as any number multiplied by zero equals zero). Therefore, we subtract these two values to find that the integral from 0 to 1 for \\\\(x^2\\\\) yields a result of \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\) - 0 = \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{1}{3}}.\\n\\nTo clarify further: when you have an indefinite integral (antiderivative) and want to evaluate it between two limits, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that if F(x) is any antiderivative for f(x), then \\\\(\\\\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)\\\\). In this case we used our indefinite integral as F(x) and evaluated it at x = 1 (upper bound) and subtracted its value at the lower limit, which was zero.\"},\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":84176461297,\"load_duration\":235218398,\"prompt_eval_count\":36,\"prompt_eval_duration\":1413813312,\"eval_count\":490,\"eval_duration\":43017804380}\n",
