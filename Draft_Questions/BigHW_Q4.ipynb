    "The input of this function is a string length, `n`; and the output is a string of random 1s and 0s, of length `n`. `rand(['0', '1'])` randomly selects and returns the char '0' or '1'. An array comprehension is used to generate `n` (12, by default) of these characters, and they get stored together in a `Vector{Char}`. The splat operator, `...`, then unpacks this array into `n` individual `Char` arguments, which are then sent to the string concatonation operator, `*`, joining them into one string.\n",

    "The input of this function is a string length, `n`; and the output is a string containing a random hexadecimal (base-16) number. The first (maybe, innermost?) part of the function `union('0':'9','A':'F')`, creates a 16 element `Vector{Char}`. The objects '0':'9' and 'A':'F' are ranges, which, when passed to the union function, are unpacked into arrays, and the union of the two arrays is taken. `rand(union('0':'9','A':'F'))` randomly selects and returns one of these characters. An array comprehension is then used to select `n` (3, by default) of these random characters and put them in their very own `Vector{Char}`. Finally, the same splat+concatonation trick is used to convert the vector of characters into a single string, which effectively contains a hexadecimal number."

    "This was a fun task. I realised that `1:length(str)` will increment the exponent from left to right, when numbers are read from right to left. My inital solution involved me reversing the string, but I decided it would be better to just step from the largest number down to 0, backwards. The binary converter is clean, but I really wanted to avoid having a tower of `if... elseif ... else` in my hexdec converter. A wise man once said \"when in doubt, use a hashtable,\" so thats what I did. Though, it's possible that, as is the case in my original code, I don't think that initialising a dictonary everytime you call the function is more performant than the `if` tower. C++ has a wonderful feature, where you can initalise a function-scope variable with the `static` keyword, and it remains mutable in memory for the lifetime of the program, and only the function can see it and modify it. So good for these purposes. I looked around to try and find something like this in Julia, and the best I could come up with is this `let` keyword, which initalises the dictonary once, and lets me define a function in global namespace which has access to that variable. Kind of close, its a little clunkier then C++'s `static`. But rambling aside, the functions are implemented, and there is 0 delta between my sum and the original `parse`'s sums!"
