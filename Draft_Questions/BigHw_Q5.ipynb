    "When I was thinking about writing this code, I imagined myself ranging `n` between 1 and 1000, generating its divisors, calculating its sigma, and then recursively calculating the sigma's for each of its proper divisors, testing are they deficient or not. I felt like this was too computationally inefficient for my liking. Instead, I decided to do something a little more interesting, and generate each number's divisors exactly once, then caching it's \"type\" (deficient, perfect, abundant) in a hashtable; then, I'd have $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ access to each number's type.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. In the final part of the code, initally, I had `for n in keys(numbers)`, but it was printing the PANs in a seemingly random order. An LLM explained to me that `Dicts` are unordered, and output keys to me in order of their hashes, not the values themselves (something about putting the hashes in buckets?). Anyway, no problem I thought, `for n in sort(keys(numbers))`, but that's how I learned that `keys(numbers)` returns a generator, and `sort` doesn't accept generators as an argument (this is contrary to Python, for example, where you can pass iterables to standard functions, generally, no problem). The LLM helped me learn that the function `collect` allows me to collect all the entries in a generator, and return them in a vector. Hence, the final solution had the line `for n in sort(collect(keys(number)))` (The \"final part\" printing part of the code has been ommited, now that I have function-ified `findPANs`, to make 5(c) easier)"
